    <td>After several trips down the Ard&egrave;che in the South of France I got hooked
      on canoeing and eventually decided to take the plunge and buy myself a
      canoe. This is a 14ft Mobile Adventure and although primarily a 2 man canoe
      it can be handled on your own in calm weather. This picture was taken on the River Stour near Stratford St. Mary.</td>

    <td> Having got the bug I decided to invest in a smaller kayak (Perception
      Acadia) to paddle on solo trips. Being only 2/3 the weight of the canoe
      it's easier to get
      on top of the car and ideal when no one else is around to help paddle or
      load.</td>
