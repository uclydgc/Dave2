    <td><p align="left">I live in the small village of <a href="http://www.galleywood.org.uk">Galleywood</a>          about 3 miles south of Chelmsford, the county town of Essex. I was educated 
          at Galleywood infant and primary schools before going to Great Baddow 
          Comprehensive School. After leaving school I joined Marconi Radar Systems 
          first as a technician apprentice and then a technician in their research 
          and development section. After being made redundant from Marconi in 
          1988 I joined UCL as a technician in charge of the Experimental Phonetics 
          Laboratory. My hobbies are many and varied and include <a
        href="car/index.html">Cars</a>, <a href="cave/index.html">Caving</a>, 
          <a href="canoe/index.html">Canoeing</a>, and my latest hobby <a href="geocaching/index.html">Geocaching</a>.</p></td>
