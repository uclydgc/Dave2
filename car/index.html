      utilised the 1000cc engine
    from the Mini and went through several stages of tuning before being replaced
      by a 1300 Cooper S unit. Although this car was not particularly good looking
      (often described as a
    bath tub on wheels) it did however have a great power to weight ratio and
    excellent road holding which allowed it to corner like it was on rails. </td>

    painted in its distingtive colours. This was also originally powered by a 1000cc engine
