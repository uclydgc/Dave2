<p align="center"><b>I bought the Landrover Discovery in May 2001 to replace my 
  ageing MR2. The car originally had about 130,000 miles on it but is now only 
  a couple of thousand miles short of 200,000. I have had to replace both the 
  transfer box and steering box along with numerous bearings and seals. The car 
  is pretty much standard with only minimal protection added to the underside. 
  Diff guards both front and rear and a Terrain Master steering guard up front 
  to provide both protection and recovery points. I don't have a electrical winch 
  but carry a hand winch when venturing off road. Hella 300 Lamps on the front 
  provide ample illumination in the dark.</b></p>
<p align="center"><b>In April 2004 I replaced the 200tdi which had covered in excess 
  of 200,000 miles with a newer 300tdi ES, with 45,000 miles on the clock. The 
  steering and diff guards have now been transferred over along with the spot lights.</b></p>
